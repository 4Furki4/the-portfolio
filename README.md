## Tech and Libraries

- Utilized Next.js 13 app router with React.js
- Implemented [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library for the animations.
- Used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- Implemented [ts-particles](https://github.com/tsparticles/tsparticles) for generating amazing and interactional background
- Used somewhat [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the education cards and [NextUI](https://nextui.org/docs/components/navbar#controlled-menu) library for the navbar.
- Tried new Next.js and React features like useFormStatus and form actions.

 ## Planned Features to be Added.

 - Internationalization using next-intl for the Turkish translation. (I'm able to implement it using next-intl in client-side components but I'm waiting for the stable release for server-side components)

   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
   - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
   - DATABASE_URL=
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

-------------------------------------------
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
